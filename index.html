            <h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
            <p>
            An adaptable and motivated individual aspiring to become a Cloud or Devops Engineer. I’m
            a strong advocate of DevOps practice. I am interested in the DevOps and cloud scene and
            culture and aim to build the necessary skills and knowledge to get a position. I enjoy being
            challenged and put out my comfort zone and always try my best to manage to adapt to a
            fast paced environment. I work efficiently whilst under pressure and always make sure I
            meet deadlines. I am currently studying towards an AWS and GCP certification whilst also
            ensuring I understand many of the concepts that are part of a DevOps environment. I’m
            always experimenting with different technologies and how they work in a commercial
            environment that champions DevOps and automation.</p>

                <h2>Self learning</h2>
                <b><p>Self taught skills from acloudguru.com and Linux Academy.</p></b>

                        configuration of security networks ​ and managed storage.</li>
                    <li><b>S3​ -</b> I used Amazon S3 to write data to a bucket and also use FTP to store data into a
                        bucket ​ . I’ve also managed to take snapshots of RDS and store them into S3.</li>
                    <li><b>RDS​ -</b> Creation and configuration of RDS parameter groups, DB Instances, snapshots
                        and read replicas.</li>
                    <li><b>Lambda​ -</b>  Created a lambda function that can grab data from an S3 bucket and store
                        them into a DynamoDB table.</li>
                    <li><b>Docker​ -</b>  Installation of Docker and Docker compose. Wrote a basic docker file from
                        scratch and understood the components that go into that docker file and managed to
                        run the dockerfile and start it as a container</li>
                    <li><b>Linux​ -</b>  Comfortable in navigation of the file system. Understand the use cases of
                        certain important directories such as the /etc directory and the /var/log directory.
                        Understand how SSH works and the concept of it and have managed to SSH into

                        important it is in the development of new infrastructure using code as opposed to
                        the console. I’ve managed to spin up new resources such as EC2 instances, VPC
                        networks, and S3 buckets. I’ve also understood the need for state files within
