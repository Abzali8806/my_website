            <h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
            <p>
                An adaptable and motivated individual aspiring to become a Cloud or Devops Engineer. I’m
                a strong advocate of DevOps practice. I am interested in the DevOps and cloud scene and
                culture and aim to build the necessary skills and knowledge to get a position. I enjoy being
                challenged and put out my comfort zone and always try my best to manage to adapt to a
                fast paced environment. I work efficiently whilst under pressure and always make sure I
                meet deadlines. I am currently studying towards an AWS and GCP certification whilst also
                ensuring I understand many of the concepts that are part of a DevOps environment. I’m
                always experimenting with different technologies and how they work in a commercial
                environment that champions DevOps and automation.</p>
