As my first significant project in web development I've decided to create my very own C.V. website to showcase me, my Interests, Experience, Projects, Education and talents to prospective employers and to the simply curious.

I'm a amateur so I'm coding this site as I learning web development, hence you'll witness my gradual progress.

New to web dev, a little less new to python programming
